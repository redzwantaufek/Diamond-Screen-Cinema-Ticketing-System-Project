# 1.	Project Background

 Our Diamond Screen Cinema (DSC) Ticketing System is a system provide various type of cinema such as Imax, Dolby, standard, deluxe, luxury and many more. The price for each type of cinema will be different because of the experience itself. Our system operates 7 days a week from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m. The process of buying ticket will fully be conduct through online, so there will be no line to be queue. Being a membership will give you 5% discount for all the purchase you made. For now, that’s all the discount we have and there is no other discount available, but we assure that many more discounts will be in this system when the upcoming time.

First you need to select your type of cinema there is a selection where you would be able to buy food and beverages on the spot. You could enjoy our 5 Michelin star Nasi Kerabu while watching your movie. After you are done, our platform will bring you to the last section which is the amount of tickets you want. When you finished you are good to go and enjoy your movie.

Due to our policy during the pandemic, our system only allow customer to purchase maximum 3 foods. There is no social distancing seat in the hall so you could side by side with your family and friends during the movie.

 
# 2.	Problem Statement 

The main problem we saw in ticketing system especially a “walk in” system or kiosk system is people need to come to the cinema to buy the ticket and this will make the surrounded area so crowded.

Next problem is the difficulty to manage the transaction process of paying the ticket. From the previous system we normally had to pay with cash and there are not many varieties of options to pay with. 

Last problem that is typically happen is the ticket itself. Normally we get a piece of paper and all the information about our movie payment, time, seat and foods and beverages are appeared there. Have we ever wondered what happen if we lose it? We probably need to buy another set of ticket, food, and beverages. 
 
# 3.	Project Objective 

Crowded area is not the issue in our system. Our goal is to develop a ticketing system that are time friendly and ease the process of buying the ticket efficiently, so our customer can save their time and not to be bother by the long line and the crowded people.
 
During this time technology has gone beyond our expectation where people are more prefer to cashless. So, our system will allow you to make a payment with various type of payment such as online banking, E-Wallet, Credit or Debit Card, PayPal, Cryptocurrency.

The missing ticket problem will not occur on our system because we develop a system where after you are done purchasing you will be given a QR code. Everything you need to do is to save the QR code and inside the QR code you have all the information you need like the seat, time, payment, and all. No need to bother to bring your piece of paper wherever you got and afraid of lose it.
